# Intel-8085-Mnemonic-based-simulator-An-Android-project

An android app to simulate 8085 microprocessor, which is now compatible with 68 instructions.

#Basic classes

1.MainActivity(activity class)- to create the instruction set

2.Fetching(activity class)-Which makes fetching and execution of assembly program

3.Instructions- A class contains the properties and list of all instructions

Apart from all other assembly simulators, this app only focuses on mnemonic based simulations. User can check their logic of
assembly instruction set without any entry of opcodes. Purely created for check our logic.
